# Personalized Healthcare & Medicine Recommendation System

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms and provides personalized healthcare recommendations, BMI analysis, health risk assessment, and analytics using Streamlit.

---

## Project Overview

This project is designed to assist users in identifying possible diseases based on selected symptoms. It also calculates the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI), estimates health risk, recommends medicines and lifestyle suggestions, and provides an analytics dashboard.

## Features

- Patient Registration
- Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
- Prediction Confidence Score
- BMI Calculation
- Health Risk Assessment
- Medicine Recommendation
- Lifestyle Recommendation
- Patient Summary
- Healthcare Analytics Dashboard
- Prediction History
- Disease Distribution Chart
- Download Patient Report (CSV)

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Joblib
